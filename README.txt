Description:

Madness Multiplier is a database-backed website that reimagines the excitement of March Madness through a structured, point-based wagering system. Players place wagers using fake money on NCAA tournament games, with multipliers determined by the relative seeding of the teams. The platform tracks wagers, calculates payouts automatically, and maintains live leaderboards for pools of friends or larger groups. 

Progress Since Milestone 1: 

Each member has contributed to making the idea of Madness Multiplier more concrete, building a lightweight prototype in Google Sheets, and brainstorming the Database schema. 

Zach: Refined the project structure, worked on database schema planning, and contributed to the prototype

Andrew: Backend planning and helped test the Google Sheets prototype

Charlie: Worked on a logo and front-end ideation

Justin: Supported prototype testing and helped define how wagers and leaderboards will interact in the final build.

Logan: Researched data sources for score data 

Additional Updates:

After fleshing out the idea further, we decided to populate our data tables that store March Madness seedings with historical data from past tournaments, since official 2026 seedings are unavailable during this phase. Weâ€™re also exploring alternative APIs to ingest March Madness data dynamically when the season begins.
Using the Google Sheets prototype, we successfully tested odds calculations, leaderboard updates, and wager tracking before beginning full implementation.
