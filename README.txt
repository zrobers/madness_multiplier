Description:

Madness Multiplier is a database-backed website that reimagines the excitement of March Madness through a structured, point-based wagering system. Players place wagers using fake money on NCAA tournament games, with multipliers determined by the relative seeding of the teams. The platform tracks wagers, calculates payouts automatically, and maintains live leaderboards for pools of friends or larger groups.
